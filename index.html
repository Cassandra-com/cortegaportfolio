            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is Cassandra Ortega, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Digital Media 
                at the University of Central Florida, with a keen interest in technical communication. 
                This portfolio will be an overview of my projects from DIG 4639C Mobile Development.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> For this project I created a data driven menu that contained a 
                                MenuItem Component which rendered as HTML the following properties: itemId, itemPrice,
                                 itemName, and itemDescription. This project used React, html, and css. One problem I had
                                  encountered was with my MenuItems component. I was explicitly assigning my prop values 
                                  but realized I did not need to do that since the React.Component Class did this for me.

                            <p class="card-text">For this project I created a simple Exercise Tracker Application. 
                                It contains a variety of exercises that are assigned as a duration exercise or a 
                                repetition exercise. For a repetition exercise it maintains an increase in value 
                                when the start value is pressed. It also allows the counter to be reset. For the 
                                duration exercise it shows a stopwatch that can be paused and resetted. This was 
                                created using React, html, and css.</p>

                                add and complete tasks. The Default tasks are represented as an array with required 
                                properties, maintained as a state.This project used React, html, css. One of the problems 
                                was showing to the user a task completed once they checked off a task. It was not striking though.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> For this design assignment I created a simple wireframe in figma. 
                                The main screen for exercises displayed the following three: Push Ups, Running and Plank. 
                                There were two additional screens for the exercise type: duration and repetition. The 
                                duration screen contained a timer that could count up and allowed resetting. The repetition 
                                screen included a way to increase the rep count. I think the hardest part for this assignment
                                 was getting started and finding a color palette I liked. Once I found the upbeat palette I 
                                 wanted it made it easier to work with.

                                 continued the following: task creation, task list, task deletion, task deadline, user identity,
                                  login/signout, task completion, and completed tasks. Where I struggled and did not get to 
                                  finish was the filtering of completed tasks. I did not know how I wanted to categorize my tasks.
                                   I wanted to give them a label but ran out of time. </p>
